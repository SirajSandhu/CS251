\section{Introduction} 
Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science useful in numerous applications. Given a sequence of numbers as input, the output should provide a non-decreasing sequence of numbers as output. More formally, we define a sorting problem as follows [1],\newline
\textbf{Input:} A sequence of n numbers $\big \langle a_{1},a_{2}, ..., a_{n}\big \rangle.$
\textbf{Output:} A reordered sequence (of size n) $\big \langle a_{1}^{'},a_{2}^{'}, ..., a_{n}^{'}\big \rangle$ of the input sequence such that $a_1^{'} \leq a_2^{'} \leq ... \leq a_n^{'}.$\newline
Consider the following example. Given an input sequence $\big \langle 8, 34, 7, 9, 15, 34, 91 \big \rangle$, a sorting algorithm should return $\big \langle 7,8,9,15,15,34,91 \big \rangle$ as output.\newline
\indent A fundamental problem like sorting has attracted many researchers who contributed with innovative algorithms to solve the problem of sorting \textit{efficiently} [3]. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on primarily on two aspects,
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time complexity} is a formalism that captures running time of an algorithm in terms of the input size. Normally, \textit{asymptotic} behavior on the input size is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Space complexity} is a formalism that captures amount of memory used by an algorithm in terms of input size. Like time complexity analysis, asymptotic analysis is used for space complexity.
\end{itemize}
In the branch of algorithms and complexity in computer science, space complexity takes a back seat compared to to time complexity. Recently, another parameter of computing i.e., energy consumption has become popular. Roy et al. [4] proposed an energy complexity model for algorithms. In this document, we will deal with time complexity of sorting algorithms.\newline
\indent One class of algorithms which are based on \textit{element comparison} are commonly known as \textit{comparison based sorting algorithms}. In this document, we will provide a brief overview of \texttt{Quicksort}, a commonly used comparison based sorting algorithm [2]. Quicksort is a sorting algorithm  based on \textit{divide-and-conquer} paradigm of algorithm design. Further, we will derive the lower bound of any comparison based sorting algorithm to be $\Omega(n \log_{2} n)$ for an input size of n.

\section{Quicksort}
% \titlespacing{\section}{10pt}{*10}{*10}
Quicksort is designed as a three-step divide-and-conquer process for sorting an input sequence in an array [1]. For any given subarray, $A[i..j]$, the process is as follows,\newline
\textbf{Divide:} The array $A[i..j]$ is partitioned into two subarrays $A[i..k]$ and $A[k+1..j]$ such that all elements in $A[i..k]$ is less than or equal to all elements in $A[k+1..j]$. A partitioning procedure is called to determine $k$ such that at the end of partitioning, the element at the $k^{th}$ position (i.e., $A[k]$) does not change its position in the final output array.


\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Partition procedure of \texttt{Quicksort} algorithm.}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Partition}{$A, i, j$} % variables are typeset differently
    \Statex\Comment{$A$ is an array of $N$ integers, $A[1..N]$}
    \Statex\Comment{$i$ and $j$ are the start and end of subarray}
    \State $x \gets A[i]$
    \State $y \gets i - 1$ % gets is used for assignation
    \State $z \gets j + 1$
    \While{$(true)$}
        \State $z \gets z - 1$
        \While{$A[z] > x$}
            \State $z \gets z - 1$
        \EndWhile
        \State $y \gets y + 1$
        \While {$A[y] < x$}
            \State $y \gets y + 1$
        \EndWhile
        \If { $y < z$}
            \State Swap $A[y] \leftrightarrow A[z]$
        \Else
            \State return z
        \EndIf
    \EndWhile
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\noindent\textbf{Conquer:}Recursively invoke \texttt{Quicksort} on the two subarrays. This procedure conquers the complexity by applying the same operations in two subarrays.\newline
\textbf{Merge:} Quicksort does not require merge or combine operation as the entire array $A[i..j]$ is sorted in place.\newline
\indent In the heart of \texttt{Quicksort}, there is a partition procedure as shown in Algotithm 1. A pivot element $x$ is selected. The first inner while loop (line \#6) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is smaller than or equal to the pivot element. Similarly, the seccond inner while loop (line \#9) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the pivot element. If indices $y$ and $z$ have not exchanged their side around the pivot, the elements at $A[y]$ and $A[z]$ are exchanged. Otherwise, the procedure returns the index $z$, such that all elements to the left of $z$ are smaller than or equal to $A[z]$ and all elements to the right of $z$ are greater than or equal to $A[z]$.\newline
The main recursive procedure for \texttt{Quicksort} is
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{\texttt{Quicksort} recursion.}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{Quicksort}{$A, i, j$}
    \Statex\Comment{Quicksort procedure called with $A, 1, N$}
    \If { $i < j$}
        \State $k \gets$  \Call{Partition}{$A, i, j$} % function call --> Call
        \State \Call{Quicksort}{$A, i, k$}
        \State \Call{Quicksort}{$A, k + 1, j$}
    \EndIf
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\noindent presented in Algorithm 2. Initial invocation is performed by call QUICKSORT($A,1,N$) where  $N$ is the length of array N.

\subsection{Time Complexity analysis of \texttt{Quicksort}}
The worst case of \texttt{Quicksort} occurs when an array of length N, gets partitioned into two subarrays of size N-1 and 1 in every recursive invocation of
QUICKSORT procedure in Algorithm 2. The partitioning procedure presented in Algorithm 1, takes $\Theta(n)$ time, the recurrence relation for running time
is,
\begin{center}
    $T(n) = T(n - 1) + \Theta(n)$
\end{center}
As it is evident that $T(1) = \Theta(1)$, the recurrence is solved as follows,
\begin{align*} % align* -> align center at =
    T(n) &= T(n - 1) + \Theta(n)\\
    &=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} \Theta(k)\\
    &=\Theta\bigg(\sum\limits_{k=1}^{n} k \bigg)\\
    &=\Theta(n^2)
\end{align*}
Therefore, if the partitioning is always maximally unbalanced, the running time is $\Theta(n^2)$. Intuitively, if an input sequence is almost sorted, \texttt{Quicksort} will perform poorly. In the best case, partitioning divides the array into two equal parts. Thus, the recurrence for the best case is given by,
\begin{align*}
    T(n) &= 2T\bigg(\frac{n}{2}\bigg)+ \Theta(n)
\end{align*}
which evaluates to $ \Theta(n\log_2 n)$. Using a comparatively involved analysis, the average running time of \texttt{Quicksort} can be determined to be $O(n \lg n)$.

\section{Lower bounds on comparison sorts}
An interesting question about sorting algorithms based on comparisons is the following: What is the lower bound of this class of sorting algorithms? This question is important for algorithm researchers to further improve the sorting algorithms.\newline A decision tree based analysis leads to the following
theorem [1].
\begin{theorem}
Any decision tree that sorts n elements has height $\Omega(n\log_2 (n))$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Consider a decision tree of height $h$ that sorts $n$ elements. Since there are $n!$ permutations of $n$ elements, each permutation representing a distinct sorted order, the tree must have at least $n!$ leaves. Since a binary tree of height $h$ has no more than $2h$ leaves. So,
\begin{flalign*} % flalign* -> left align at =	
    n! \leq 2^h &&
\end{flalign*}
Applying logarithmic $(\log_2)$, the inequality becomes, 
\begin{flalign*}
    h \geq \lg(n!). &&
\end{flalign*}
Applying Stirling's approximations, 
\begin{flalign*}
    n! > \bigg(\frac{n}{e}\bigg) ^n, &&
\end{flalign*}
where $e$ is the natural base of logarithms. Further, 
\begin{align*}
    h &\geq \lg \bigg(\frac{n}{e}\bigg) ^n\\
    &= n\lg n - n \lg e\\
    &= \Omega(n\lg n)
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
